    <h1>BALOCHISTAN</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Balochistan (/bəˌloʊtʃɪˈstɑːn/; Urdu: بلوچِستان‎) is one of the four provinces of Pakistan. It is the largest province in terms of land area, forming the southwestern region of the country, but is the least populated. Its provincial capital and largest city is Quetta.

        Balochistan shares borders with Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the northeast, Sindh to the east and southeast, the Arabian Sea to the south, Iran to the west and Afghanistan to the north and northwest.

        <p>   
            The main ethnic groups in the province are the Baloch people and the Pashtuns, who constitute 52% and 36% of the population respectively (according to the preliminary 2011 census).[5] The remaining 12% comprises smaller communities of Brahuis, Hazaras along with other settlers such as Sindhis, Punjabis, Uzbeks and Turkmens. The name "Balochistan" means "the land of the Baloch". Largely underdeveloped, its provincial economy is dominated by natural resources, especially its natural gas fields, estimated to have sufficient capacity to supply Pakistan's demands over the medium to long term. Aside from Quetta, the second-largest city of the province is Turbat in the south, while another area of major economic importance is Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.</p>

            Quetta (Pashto: کوټه‎ ; IPA [ˈkʰwəː tə]; Balochi: کویته‎;Urdu: کوئٹہ‎; [ˈkweːʈə] (About this soundlisten); formerly known as Shalkot[3] is the provincial capital and largest city of the Province of Balochistan in Pakistan. It is also the 10th largest city of Pakistan.[4] It was largely destroyed in the 1935 Quetta earthquake, but was rebuilt and has a population of 1,001,205 according to the census of 2017.[5][2][6] Quetta is at an average elevation of 1,680 metres (5,510 feet) above sea level,[7] making it Pakistan's only high-altitude major city. The city is known as the "Fruit Garden of Pakistan," due to the numerous fruit orchards in and around it, and the large variety of fruits and dried fruit products produced there.[8]
